The following folders are for the map data of CC2's Office. The folder called "Low Encounter Rate" treats the S.G.F.P. troop the same as Freddy Plush's troop, in the sense he will be rare to come across and that you will encounter other enemies before encountering S.G.F.P.

The folder called "Instant Boss" makes S.G.F.P. the only troop that can appear in the Office, meaning every encounter in the office will be against S.G.F.P. This is for if you don't want to deal with all of the other enemies and just want to fight him instantly.

In short, the "Low Encounter Rate" folder is people that want to treat S.G.F.P. like a legitimate secret boss, and the "Instant Boss" folder is for people that just want to fight him quicker. Regardless, you still need to play the game on Proud Mode in order to face him.

It's ultimately up to you on how you want to encounter him. Pick your poison!
