These are the files for the original/harder S.G.F.P. fight, where it is extremely difficult with almost all of his attacks dealing more damage, him being limited on how many ATK debuffs he can receive, him taking less damage, and him being more resistant to status effects.

This version of fight is completely doable, but if you find it to be too hard/ruining your enjoyment, then use the files from the "Fair Mode" folder instead.
