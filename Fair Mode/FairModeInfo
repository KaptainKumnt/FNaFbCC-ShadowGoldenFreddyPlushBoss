These are the files for an easier boss fight against S.G.F.P., where he takes more damage, deals less damage overall, is less resistant to status effects, him no longer having a limit on how much his ATK can be debuffed, nerfed rewards, and overall being treated more like a legitimate boss that you'd see in the Complete Collection.

If you find this boss too easy and want something to stress over, then use the files from the "Critical Mode" folder instead.
